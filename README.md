### Features Left to Implement

- List of all users with filters.
- Custom error code pages.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Python3
- [Materialize 1.0.0](https://materializecss.com/)
	- The Materialize framework was used to establish the look and feel of the site. It provided a repsonsive layout, as well as various components and UI elements for the site. Additional styles were added through the use of SCSS, both to expand upon, and reduce the size of the css for the site.
- [Cash](https://kenwheeler.github.io/cash/)
	- Cash is used as an alternative to JQuery for DOM manipulation. It comes bundled with the latest version of Materialize, and has a much smaller footprint than JQuery.
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
	- Sass was used to preprocess and compile stylesheets for the site.
- [Flask 1.0.2](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
	- The Flask micro-framework serves the site over HTTP.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
	- MongoDB handles the document based database for storing recipes and user information. The database for the main deployment is provided by the [MongoDB Atlas Cloud](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud) service.
- [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
	- Amazon AWS S3 storage was used to provide persistent storage for user images. The [Boto3 python API](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) was used to interface with the S3 service.

### Tools

- [Sublime Text 3.2.1](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
	- Sublime text was used to write the code for the site.
	- [Emmet](https://emmet.io/) package was used to speed up davelopment.
	- [HTML-CSS-JS Prettify](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/HTML-CSS-JS%20Prettify) package was used to prettify code layout.
	- [Anaconda](http://damnwidget.github.io/anaconda/) package was used as a PEP8 linter to write neater error free code.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
	- Git was used for version control, and GitHub was used for remote storage of repositories.
- [GIMP 2.10.8](https://www.gimp.org/)
	- GIMP 2 was used for image editing.
- [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/)
	- Inkscape was used to create the logo and additional icons for the site.

## Testing

A full breakdown and examples of the testing approach can be found [here](https://github.com/ASquirrelsTail/cookbook/blob/master/tests/testing.md).

The site has been tested on a variety of devices, using different browsers and resolutions to ensure compatability and responsiveness.

HTML code was validated by the [WC3 Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/), as Jinja templates tend to cause confusion, the rendered templates of a selection of pages were fed into the validator instead.

CSS code was validated using the [WC3 CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), and unsuprisingly passed, as it was generated by Sass. Javascript was checked using [JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/).

Manual testing was used to test the front-end of the site, such as form validation and general functionality.

A test driven development process was followed for the backend, adding a test for each new feature and checking that test failed before doing what was necessary to ensure the test passed before repeating the process for the next feature. Once the test spec was developed and features implemented the code could be refactored and retested to ensure nothing broke. The whole test suite could be rerun after other features were added to ensure they didn't impact earlier features.

Example users were created to walk through the user stories established [here](https://github.com/ASquirrelsTail/cookbook/blob/master/preprod/ux.md).

## Deployment


## Known Issues

Deleting a recipe means any parent or child recipes that referenced it will now link to a page that doen't exist.

Deleting a comment when another user has deleted a comment after you have loaded the page will result in the wrong comment being deleted due to the way comments are referenced by index.

Due to the use of ES6 let keyword, and object function declarations the site only supports IE11 and later. This could be ammended, however Cash and Materialize also only supports IE10 and later anyway.
